# CVE-2019-14339 (Reserved)

Content Provider URI Injection on Canon PRINT 2.5.5 (CVE-2019-14339). Proof of concept by [@0x48piraj](https://twitter.com/0x48piraj)

The **ContentProvider** in the **Canon PRINT 2.5.5** application for Android does not properly restrict data access. This allows an attacker's malicious application to obtain sensitive information including factory passwords for administrator web-interface and WPA2-PSK key.


## Impact

This bug can leak data from every printer which Canon PRINT 2.5.5 supports, i.e.

- PIXMA TS Series
- TR Series, MG Series, PRO Series, MP Series, iP Series, iX Series
- MAXIFY MB Series, iB Series
- ImagePROGRAF PRO Series, TM Series
- SELPHY CP900 Series, CP1200, CP1300

#### App downloads : 1,00,00,000 +

## The bug

The mobile application contains unprotected exported content providers ('IJPrinterCapabilityProvider'in `android/AndroidManifest.xml`) that discloses sensitive applicationâ€™s data under certain conditions.

To securely export the content provider, one should restrict access to it by setting up `android:protectionLevel` or `android:grantUriPermissions` attributes in **Android Manifest** file.

## What do you need?

- Canon PRINT 2.5.5 (latest) Android app installed.
- A Canon printer supported by the application

## How do I run it?

There are two ways to test this vulnerability.

- Over ADB
- Via malicious Android app

### Over ADB

Setup ADB, clone the repository, goto `/poc-scripts` and run `leak.py`

```
git clone https://github.com/0x48piraj/CVE-2019-14339
cd CVE-2019-14339/poc-scripts
python leak.py
```

### Via malicious Android app

#### Method #1

Clone the repository, build the source.

#### Method #2

Use pre-built app by going under `/release` and downloading [cannon-pwn.apk](/release/cannon-pwn.apk) or via [releases](https://github.com/0x48piraj/CVE-2019-14339/releases)

> **NOTE:** Disable Play Protect or it'll throw "App Not Installed" error, (within Google Play)> Menu> Play Protect> Scan device for security threats (disable).

## Issues (?)

Issues have been disabled on this repository. It is a simple proof of concept I wanted to share with the community.
