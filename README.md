# CVE-2019-729523

Content Provider URI Injection CVE-2019-729523 Proof of concept by [@0x48piraj](https://twitter.com/0x48piraj).

The **ContentProvider** in the **Canon PRINT 2.5.5** application for Android does not properly restrict data access. This allows an attacker's malicious application to obtain sensitive information including factory passwords for administrator web-interface and WPA2-PSK key.


## Impact

This bug can leak data from every printer which Canon PRINT 2.5.5 supports, i.e.

- PIXMA TS Series
- TR Series, MG Series, PRO Series, MP Series, iP Series, iX Series
- MAXIFY MB Series, iB Series
- ImagePROGRAF PRO Series, TM Series
- SELPHY CP900 Series, CP1200, CP1300

#### App downloads : 1,00,00,000 +

## What do you need?

- Canon PRINT 2.5.5 (latest) Android app installed.
- A Canon printer supported by the application

## How do I run it?

There are two ways to test this vulnerability.

- Over ADB
- Via malicious Android app
